There are critical data accuracy issues that need to be fixed immediately:

PROBLEM 1: COUNTRY MISMATCH
The Lebanon card shows "Lebanon Economic & Refugee Crisis" but the description says "hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees" - this is confusing affected country with host country.

FIX REQUIRED:
- Lebanon IS experiencing a crisis (economic collapse + refugee burden), so the card is correct
- But the summary is poorly written - it should focus on Lebanon's humanitarian situation, not Syria
- Review ALL 31 conflicts and verify:
  * Title matches the affected country
  * Summary describes that country's crisis, not neighboring countries
  * "Most Affected" groups are accurate for that specific country
  * Region tag is correct (Lebanon should be "Middle East" ✓)

Example fix for Lebanon card:
- Current: "Economic collapse combined with hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees has created widespread humanitarian needs..."
- Better: "Severe economic collapse has left 80% of the population in poverty. Combined with hosting 1.5 million refugees, Lebanon faces critical shortages in healthcare, electricity, and basic services..."

PROBLEM 2: ALL CARDS SHOW THE SAME IMAGE
Every conflict is showing the same stock photo of children - this is wrong and misleading.

ROOT CAUSE DIAGNOSIS:
Check the database - are imageUrl fields all pointing to the same file? Or is the frontend not loading unique images correctly?

FIX REQUIRED:
1. For each of the 31 conflicts, check if ReliefWeb API provided real photos:
   - If yes AND photo is non-graphic (no blood, violence, destruction): use that photo with proper credit
   - If no OR photo is graphic: create unique colored severity cards (NO stock photos of people)

2. Colored severity card design:
   - Critical severity = deep red/burgundy solid color background
   - High severity = orange solid color background  
   - Moderate severity = yellow/amber solid color background
   - Overlay the country name and region on the card
   - NO photos of people unless they're verified real photos from the actual crisis

3. NEVER use the same generic stock photo across multiple crises - this is exploitative and misleading

4. Check database schema:
```sql
   SELECT country, imageUrl, severityLevel FROM conflicts;
```
   Show me the results - are all imageUrls identical?

5. If ReliefWeb API responses included images, extract them properly:
   - Parse the image URL from API response
   - Validate it's non-graphic (check metadata/tags)
   - Store unique imageUrl per conflict in database
   - Add photo credit: "Photo: UN OCHA/[photographer]"

6. Frontend image loading:
   - Verify Discover.tsx is actually using conflict.imageUrl, not a hardcoded placeholder
   - Add fallback: if imageUrl is null/broken, show severity-colored card

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Audit all 31 conflicts in database - show me the data for Lebanon, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Gaza to verify accuracy
2. Fix country/description mismatches 
3. Implement unique images per conflict (real photos OR severity cards - NO generic stock photos)
4. Test that Pass/Details/Support buttons work correctly
5. Show me 5 example cards after fixes to confirm each has unique, appropriate imagery

This is critical for credibility - we cannot show the same photo for Lebanon, Sudan, and Haiti. Each crisis needs accurate information and appropriate imagery.

Fix these issues NOW and show me the corrected Lebanon card data.
