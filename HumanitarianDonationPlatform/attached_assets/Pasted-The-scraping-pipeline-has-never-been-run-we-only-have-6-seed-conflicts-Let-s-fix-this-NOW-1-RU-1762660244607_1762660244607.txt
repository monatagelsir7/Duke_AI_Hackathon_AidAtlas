The scraping pipeline has never been run - we only have 6 seed conflicts. Let's fix this NOW:

1. RUN THE PIPELINE IMMEDIATELY:
   - Trigger the scraping pipeline right now with: daysBack: 30, processLimit: 50
   - Show me how many conflicts were scraped from ReliefWeb
   - Show me 5 complete examples of the newly scraped conflicts with all fields
   - Confirm they're being stored properly

2. AUTO-PUBLISH SCRAPED CONFLICTS (remove admin approval bottleneck):
   - Modify the pipeline to automatically add scraped conflicts directly to the conflicts table
   - Skip the conflict_approvals queue for now - we need real data live immediately
   - Add a field "source: 'reliefweb'" and "needsReview: false" to track origin
   - We can add admin review back later, but users need comprehensive data NOW

3. SET UP AUTOMATIC DAILY SCRAPING:
   - Create a cron job or scheduled task that runs the pipeline every 24 hours at midnight UTC
   - Use daysBack: 7 for daily updates (we don't need to re-scrape old data)
   - Log to console when scraping starts, completes, and how many new conflicts were found
   - Handle errors gracefully (don't crash if ReliefWeb is down)

4. EXPAND TO ADDITIONAL TRUSTED SOURCES:
   You already have ACLED and ICRC documented but not implemented. Add them:
   - ACLED API (https://acleddata.com) - for conflict event data
   - ICRC Situation Reports RSS (https://www.icrc.org) - for protection concerns
   - Keep using ReliefWeb as primary source
   - Merge data from all sources, removing duplicates by country

5. VERIFY IT'S WORKING:
   After implementing, show me:
   - Total number of conflicts now in database (should be 30-50+, not just 6)
   - Breakdown by region (how many in Africa, Middle East, South Asia, etc.)
   - Confirmation that cron job is scheduled
   - Example of one conflict that came from the pipeline with all fields populated

This is critical - our users are only seeing 6 conflicts when there are 20+ active humanitarian crises worldwide. We need comprehensive, auto-updating data from trusted sources.
