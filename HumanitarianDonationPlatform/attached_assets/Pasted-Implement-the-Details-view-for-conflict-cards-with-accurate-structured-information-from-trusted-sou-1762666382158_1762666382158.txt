Implement the Details view for conflict cards with accurate, structured information from trusted sources.

WHEN THIS APPEARS:
- Details view opens as a modal/popup ONLY when user clicks the "Details" button on a conflict card
- Each conflict has its own unique details - data is specific to that conflict
- User can close/go back to return to the card view

MODAL DESIGN OPTIONS (choose the best one):

Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Overlay Modal
- Semi-transparent dark background (rgba(0,0,0,0.5) or similar) overlays the Discover page
- White/light modal box appears centered on screen
- Modal has rounded corners, drop shadow, and generous padding
- Reference design: Instagram photo details, Twitter expanded tweets, or any modern popup
- Background is dimmed but modal content is bright and readable
- Click outside modal or press X to close

Option 2 (ALTERNATIVE): Slide-up Panel
- Details slide up from bottom of screen (like Tinder profile view or Apple Maps details)
- Covers 80-90% of screen but shows a bit of the card at top
- Swipe down or tap X to close
- Good for mobile-first design

Option 3 (FALLBACK): Full Page Navigation
- Navigate to new page route (/conflict/:id/details or similar)
- Full page view of details with navbar
- Back button in navbar returns to Discover
- Use this if modal options don't look good

Implement Option 1 (overlay modal). If it looks cluttered or ugly during testing, switch to Option 2. Make sure the design is clean, professional, and readable - NOT cramped or confusing.

DETAILS PAGE STRUCTURE:

Create a clean, scannable layout with these sections (in this exact order):

1. HEADER (Top of modal)
   - Close button (X icon) in top-right corner
   - Country name (large, bold)
   - Region tag (small, subtle)
   - Severity badge (Critical/High/Moderate with matching color from card - red/orange/yellow)

2. CRISIS OVERVIEW (2-3 sentences maximum)
   - Use the "summary" field from the conflicts table in database
   - If summary is longer than 3 sentences, show only the first 2-3 sentences
   - Font: readable size, not too small
   - This gives context about what's happening

3. KEY STATISTICS SECTION (Grid or card layout with icons)
   
   Create visual cards/sections with icons for each stat:
   
   📊 PEOPLE AFFECTED
   - Total people in need: [number] OR "Data unavailable"
   - Internally displaced: [number] OR "Data unavailable"
   - Refugees abroad: [number] OR "Data unavailable"
   
   📅 TIMELINE  
   - Crisis began: [YYYY] OR "Ongoing since [year]" OR "Data unavailable"
   - Current status: "Active conflict" / "Escalating crisis" / "Ongoing emergency" OR "Data unavailable"
   
   🏥 PRIMARY HUMANITARIAN NEEDS (show top 3-4 if available)
   - Display as icon pills or tags: Food Security, Medical Care, Shelter, Clean Water, Education, Protection
   - If data exists, show it
   - If not available, show "Data unavailable"
   
   👥 MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS
   - Use the "affectedGroups" field from database (this should exist)
   - Display as colored pills/tags (same visual style as card view)
   - Examples: Children, Internally Displaced, Women, Elderly, Refugees

4. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (OPTIONAL - only show if data exists)
   - Check if you have recent update information from sources
   - If yes: show 1-2 short bullet points with dates
   - If no: SKIP THIS ENTIRE SECTION (don't show empty section or "Data unavailable")
   - This section is nice-to-have, not required

5. SOURCE ATTRIBUTION (Always show at bottom)
   - Small gray text at bottom of modal
   - "Source: UN OCHA ReliefWeb" (or whichever verified source)
   - "Last updated: [date]" - use the "lastUpdated" field from database, format as readable date like "November 8, 2025"
   - Keeps credibility and transparency

6. ACTION BUTTONS (Bottom of modal, sticky/fixed position)
   - Two buttons side by side:
   - Left button (secondary style): "← Back" - closes modal, returns to Discover cards
   - Right button (primary blue style): "💙 Support" - goes to donation/support flow for this conflict
   - Buttons should be easy to tap on mobile

VISUAL SPACING & READABILITY:
- Add proper padding between sections (not cramped)
- Use divider lines or extra spacing between major sections
- Make sure text isn't too small (especially on mobile)
- Icons should be visible but not overwhelming
- Mobile responsive: test that everything fits and is readable on phone screens
- Should fit on approximately one screen height (minimal scrolling needed)
- Clean, modern design - think Airbnb or modern app aesthetics

DATA SOURCING STRATEGY - STEP BY STEP:

Step 1: CHECK WHAT DATA EXISTS IN DATABASE
First, query the conflicts table for this specific conflict:
- Pull: country, region, title, summary, severityLevel, affectedGroups, lastUpdated
- These fields SHOULD exist for all 31 conflicts

Step 2: CHECK FOR ADDITIONAL DATA
Look for additional statistics in this priority order:
a) Check if conflicts table has additional columns like: peopleAffected, displaced, refugees, crisisStartDate, primaryNeeds
b) Check scraped_content table if it exists - see if ReliefWeb data was stored there
c) Check if you stored the raw ReliefWeb API response anywhere

Step 3: EXTRACT AVAILABLE DATA
From whatever data you find:
- People affected numbers (look for: total affected, displaced, refugees)
- Timeline info (look for: crisis start date, report dates)
- Humanitarian needs (look for: themes, needs categories from ReliefWeb)
- Status (infer from: severity + recent reports)

Step 4: HANDLE MISSING DATA GRACEFULLY
For ANY field where data doesn't exist:
- Display "Data unavailable" in a subtle gray color
- NEVER show: undefined, null, [object Object], NaN, or errors
- NEVER make up or estimate numbers - only show real source data
- Don't hide the field - show the label + "Data unavailable"

Example of proper handling:
✅ "Total people in need: Data unavailable"
✅ "Crisis began: Data unavailable"
✅ "Primary needs: Food Security, Shelter" (if you only found 2 of 3)

❌ WRONG:
"Total people in need: undefined"
"Crisis began: null"  
[Blank space where field should be]

CRITICAL RULES - NO HALLUCINATIONS:

1. ONLY display facts that exist in your database or source data
2. NEVER invent statistics, numbers, dates, or details
3. If you don't know something, say "Data unavailable" - this is better than lying
4. Don't estimate or approximate - show exact data or show unavailable
5. Don't make assumptions (e.g., don't assume crisis started in 2020 just because oldest report is from 2020)

Examples:
✅ "Crisis began: 2017" (if source explicitly states this)
✅ "Crisis began: Data unavailable" (if you don't have this info)
❌ "Crisis began: Approximately 2015-2017" (don't approximate)
❌ "Crisis began: Long-standing conflict" (too vague, not from source)

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

1. Create a Details modal component (DetailsModal.tsx or similar)

2. Add state management to Discover page:
   - Track which conflict is selected
   - Track if modal is open/closed
   
3. When user clicks "Details" button on a conflict card:
   - Set selected conflict in state
   - Pass the conflict object to modal
   - Open modal with smooth fade-in animation

4. In the modal component:
   - Query database for full conflict data
   - Check for additional statistics if available
   - Render all sections with available data
   - Show "Data unavailable" for missing fields

5. Add close functionality:
   - X button in top-right corner
   - "Back" button at bottom
   - (Optional) Click outside modal to close
   - Escape key to close
   - Smooth fade-out animation when closing

6. Make it mobile responsive:
   - Test on phone screen sizes
   - Ensure buttons are easy to tap
   - Text is readable (not too small)
   - Modal fits on screen (scrollable if needed but try to minimize scrolling)

ERROR HANDLING:

- If database query fails: show message "Unable to load details. Please try again." with retry button
- If conflict data is corrupted/malformed: show basic info (title, region) + "Some details are temporarily unavailable"
- If modal won't open: log error to console, show toast notification "Could not load details"
- Never crash the app - always degrade gracefully with error messages
- If individual fields have bad data: show "Data unavailable" for those fields only

TESTING CHECKLIST:

After implementation, test these scenarios:

✅ Click Details on Mozambique card → modal opens with Mozambique-specific data
✅ Click X or Back → modal closes smoothly, returns to card view  
✅ Click Details on Lebanon card → shows Lebanon data (different from Mozambique)
✅ Click Details on Sudan/Yemen (high-data conflicts) → all/most sections populate
✅ Click Details on a conflict with limited data → shows "Data unavailable" gracefully
✅ Test on mobile screen size → readable, buttons work, not cut off
✅ Click outside modal → closes (if you implemented this)
✅ Press Escape key → closes (if you implemented this)
✅ Verify NO undefined, null, NaN, or [object Object] visible to user
✅ Source attribution always visible at bottom
✅ Support button leads to support/donation flow

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Modal should trap focus (tab only cycles through modal elements when open)
- Escape key closes modal
- Close button has aria-label="Close"
- Modal has proper ARIA attributes (role="dialog", aria-modal="true")

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:

Good Details Modal:
- Opens smoothly when clicking Details
- Shows clean, organized information
- Has some "Data unavailable" fields (shows honesty about data limitations)
- Looks professional and modern
- Easy to read and navigate
- Source is clearly cited
- Closes smoothly
- Works on mobile

Bad Details Modal:
- Shows undefined or null to users
- Crashes when opening
- Shows made-up statistics
- Looks cluttered or ugly
- Hard to read on mobile
- No source attribution
- Can't close it easily

Implement this complete Details modal system NOW. Test it with at least 3 different conflicts (Mozambique, Lebanon, and one more) to verify each shows unique, accurate data.

After implementation, the Details feature should work perfectly for the competition demo in a few hours.
